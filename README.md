# 🧠 Brain Tumor Type Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This medical machine learning project predicts brain tumor types using structured data and exploratory analysis. Focused on classification and performance evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)
- **Size**: 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images from 233 patients
- **Classes**:
  - **Meningioma**: 708 slices
  - **Glioma**: 1,426 slices
  - **Pituitary Tumor**: 930 slices
- **Description**: This dataset contains labeled brain MRI images categorized into three tumor types: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor. Each category includes images from multiple patients, providing a diverse set for classification tasks.
